[0] Designed and implemented a browser application utilizing PoseNet(p5.js/m15) to caputure and analyze dance pases via a webcamera
[1] Engineered real-time tempo approximator that measures the period of movement by running a FFT over the captured velocity data over a specified time interval
[2] Established endpoints on an audio file's playbackrate, volume, and pitch that listen to tempo changes via websockets (Socket.io)
[3] Integrated with a generative music model (Vampnet) to continously generate new music based off of select characteristics and patterns in captured posenet data
[4] Architected a distributed software utilizing Node.js for reciving and inteperting data and Flask (python) to run the music generation model
[5] Developed a adjustable parameters such as normilization, and frames per second that allow users on the frontend to change the sensitivieties of input and capture rate to match the dancer
[6] Demoed the application at Evanston's BitCrush 2025 event, gauged user feedback and submitted plans for improvement
[7] Performed linear interpolation and outlier filtering on captured posedata to smooth out and standardize approximated velocity, significantly improving consistency

[0] Developed a web application enabling musicians to upload melodies in MusicXML/MXL format and download modified XML files with melodies harmonized programmatically into a musical soli
[1] Provided a heuristics modifier based off of chorst structure from Music21 (python), supporting thousands of note-chord combinations and common harmonization options
[2] Stored user-defined presets in browser local storage alongside a few well known haromization algorithms from well know arrangers(Count Basie, Stan Kenton, Thad Jones)
[3] Conducted over 20 test cases to handle edge cases, ensuring program will continue to finish a task
[4] Implemented RESTful APIs to manage XML and musicXML file exchange and streamline client-server communication.
[5] Built a customizable fallback algorithm that harmonizes on a more consistent basis on note/harmony parings that were not successfull in the intial run
[6] Improved runtime speed of music XML parsing/modifying programs 9 times by caching runtime results in a json file that is eventually stored on the users localStorage.
[7] Launched and maintined a website that allows users to share their own custom made harmonization algorithms.

[0] Developed a desktop application with Electron JS utilizes LLMS to select attributes of experiences and projects that best fit a job description
[1] Designed a multipaged UI to create, modify, and save a megaresume utilizing Electron's IPC. 
[2] Cut token usage nearly 50% by directing LLMs to reply with indexed outputs instead of echoing input context.
[3] Developing a optional keyword extration preprocessing stage that selects keywords and verbs and "upgrades" them to match keywords of the job description
[4] Developed interactive suggestion review system in the UI with Accept/Reject/Edit options for each AI-generated resume improvement.
[5] Developed plugin-based architecture supporting multiple AI providers with encrypted local storage utilizing node-keytar and model controll in the UI
[6] Established a Resume/Job dictionary on the client's localstorage that details the exact optimized resume permuation for any given job

[0] Developed a music recommendation platform integrating OpenAI's GPT API with the Spotify's Web API, enabling dynamic playlist generation from natural language queries.
[1] Implemented relational data persistence using Amazon RDS (MySQL), storing user accounts, playlists, and historical queries to enhance personalization
[2] Deployed backend services on Amazon EC2, handling user authentication and API communication
[3] Designed and documented a RESTful API with endpoints for song discovery, listing favorites, history, catalog reset, and recommendation refinement.
[4] Built sentiment analysis pipeline using OpenAI embeddings to categorize user music preferences and mood-based recommendations.
[5] Implemented OAuth 2.0 integration with Spotify for secure user authentication and playlist management permissions.
[6] Created Redis caching layer to optimize API response times and reduce external API calls by 60%.
[7] Developed Node.js middleware for rate limiting and error handling to ensure stable service performance under high load.
[8] Built comprehensive logging system using Winston to track user interactions and API performance metrics for analytics.

[0] Evaluated and ranked outputs from Scale AI's LLM, offering detailed feedback on ethical considerations, language clarity, and visual coherence.
[1] Ensured responses met factual accuracy standards to improve AI model performance and reliability.
[2] Developed comprehensive evaluation rubrics and scoring systems to standardize assessment of AI-generated content across multiple domains.
[3] Collaborated with cross-functional teams to identify bias patterns and recommend model training improvements for better ethical alignment.
[4] Analyzed statistical trends in AI output quality using Python data analysis tools to provide actionable insights for model optimization.
[5] Created detailed annotation guidelines and training materials for new evaluators to maintain consistency in AI training data quality.
[6] Performed comparative analysis between different AI model versions to track improvement metrics and performance degradation patterns.
