# Work and Projects

## Northwestern University - Computer Vision Developer, *Python*, *p5.js*, *PoseNet*, *Flask*, *Node.js*

- Mar 2025 – June 2025
- Designed and implemented a web application that video-captures poses and modifies a music loop using PoseNet (p5.js)
- Engineered real-time tempo approximator that measures the rhythm of motion utilizing a FFT a velocity time series that pitch shifts, alter playbackrate, and changes the volume of the audio accordingly
- Integrated with Vampnet that will continously generate new music based off the standard deviation over the range of motion
- Utilized a Node server that recieves motion data from the browser via websocket emits to perform more intensive mathemticaly operations on the time series data
- Developed a adjustable parameters such as normilization, and frames per second that allow the frontend application to adapt to the speed, height, and size of the dancer

## Harmonizer, *Python*, *JavaScript*, *HTML*, *CSS*, *XML*, *FastAPI*, *JSON*

- Nov 2024 – present
- Conducted extensive test cases to handle edge cases, enabling a cyclical development process as new chords were added and encountered.
- Developed custom XML parser optimized for MusicXML format with error handling for malformed music files.
- Stored user-defined presets in browser local storage, with future plans to server side storage
- Built a customizable fallback algorithm that harmonizes and writes for notes for notes that were missed in previous runs

## Resume Tuner, *Python*, *JSON*, *HTTP*, *docx*, *Next.js*, *Tailwind CSS*

- Mar 2025 – present
- Developed a desktop application that selects attributes of experiences and projects that best fit given a job description.
- Built cross-platform Electron/React application with TailwindCSS for dynamic resume optimization.
- Implemented an AI pipeline processing resume section by section while managing API rate limits.
- Included a option keyword extration preprocessing storage to select relevant keywords to utilize in resume filtering.
- Developed interactive suggestion review system in the UI with Accept/Reject/Edit options for each AI-generated resume improvement.

## MuseCatalog, *Node.js*, *SQL*, *AWS-RDS*, *AWS-EC2*, *Spotify-API*, *ChatGPT-API*

- Mar 2023 – May 2023
- Deployed backend services on Amazon EC2, handling user authentication and API communication
- Developed a music recommendation platform integrating OpenAI's GPT API with the Spotify's Web API, enabling dynamic playlist generation from natural language queries.
- Implemented relational data persistence using Amazon RDS (MySQL), storing user accounts, playlists, and historical queries to enhance personalization
- Built sentiment analysis pipeline using OpenAI embeddings to categorize user music preferences and mood-based recommendations.
- Created Redis caching layer to optimize API response times and reduce external API calls by 60%.

# Other Experience

## G2i, Engineer for AI Training Data

- June 2024 – July 2024
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams to identify bias patterns and recommend model training improvements for better ethical alignment.
- Analyzed statistical trends in AI output quality using Python data analysis tools to provide actionable insights for model optimization.
- Created detailed annotation guidelines and training materials for new evaluators to maintain consistency in AI training data quality.

## Self-Employed, Musician

- Sept 2020 – present
- Performed with Northwestern University Jazz Orchestra (2020–2024) and in a variety of university bands, featuring both live and virtual gigs.
- Conducted private lessons, teaching saxophone/clarinet fundamentals and improvisational listening skills to a broad range of students.
