# Work and Projects

## Northwestern University - Computer Vision Developer, *Python*, *p5.js*, *PoseNet*, *Flask*, *Node.js*

- Mar 2025 – June 2025
- Designed and implemented a browser application utilizing PoseNet(p5.js/m15) to caputure and analyze dance pases via a webcamera
- Established endpoints on an audio file's playbackrate, volume, and pitch that listen to tempo changes via websockets (Socket.io)
- Architected a distributed software utilizing Node.js for reciving and inteperting data and Flask (python) to run the music generation model
- Developed a adjustable parameters such as normilization, and frames per second that allow users on the frontend to change the sensitivieties of input and capture rate to match the dancer
- Performed linear interpolation and outlier filtering on captured posedata to smooth out and standardize approximated velocity, significantly improving consistency

## Harmonizer, *Python*, *JavaScript*, *HTML*, *CSS*, *XML*, *FastAPI*, *JSON*

- Nov 2024 – present
- Developed a web application enabling musicians to upload melodies in MusicXML/MXL format and download modified XML files with melodies harmonized programmatically into a musical soli
- Stored user-defined presets in browser local storage alongside a few well known haromization algorithms from well know arrangers(Count Basie, Stan Kenton, Thad Jones)
- Provided a heuristics modifier based off of chorst structure from Music21 (python), supporting thousands of note-chord combinations and common harmonization options
- Built a customizable fallback algorithm that harmonizes on a more consistent basis on note/harmony parings that were not successfull in the intial run
- Improved runtime speed of music XML parsing/modifying programs 9 times by caching runtime results in a json file that is eventually stored on the users localStorage.

## Resume Tuner, *Python*, *JSON*, *HTTP*, *docx*, *Next.js*, *Tailwind CSS*

- Mar 2025 – present
- Developed a desktop application with Electron JS utilizes LLMS to select attributes of experiences and projects that best fit a job description
- Developed interactive suggestion review system in the UI with Accept/Reject/Edit options for each AI-generated resume improvement.
- Cut token usage nearly 50% by directing LLMs to reply with indexed outputs instead of echoing input context.
- Developing a optional keyword extration preprocessing stage that selects keywords and verbs and `upgrades` them to match keywords of the job description

## MuseCatalog, *Node.js*, *SQL*, *AWS-RDS*, *AWS-EC2*, *Spotify-API*, *ChatGPT-API*

- Mar 2023 – May 2023
- Developed a music recommendation platform integrating OpenAI’s GPT API with the Spotify’s Web API, enabling dynamic playlist generation from natural language queries.
- Implemented relational data persistence using Amazon RDS (MySQL), storing user accounts, playlists, and historical queries to enhance personalization
- Deployed backend services on Amazon EC2, handling user authentication and API communication
- Designed and documented a RESTful API with endpoints for song discovery, listing favorites, history, catalog reset, and recommendation refinement.

# Other Experience

## G2i, Engineer for AI Training Data

- June 2024 – July 2024
- Evaluated and ranked outputs from Scale AI's LLM, offering detailed feedback on ethical considerations, language clarity, and visual coherence.
- Ensured responses met factual accuracy standards to improve AI model performance and reliability.

## Self-Employed, Musician

- Sept 2020 – present
- Performed with Northwestern University Jazz Orchestra (2020–2024) and in a variety of university bands, featuring both live and virtual gigs.
- Utilized AI music generation tools (Musicfy, Udio) alongside custom scripts to explore digital composition and arrangement.
- Conducted private lessons, teaching saxophone/clarinet fundamentals and improvisational listening skills to a broad range of students.
