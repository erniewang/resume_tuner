[0] Designed and implemented a web application that video-captures poses and modifies a music loop using PoseNet (p5.js)
[1] Engineered real-time tempo approximator that measures the rhythm of motion utilizing a FFT a velocity time series that pitch shifts, alter playbackrate, and changes the volume of the audio accordingly
[2] Integrated with Vampnet that will continously generate new music based off the standard deviation over the range of motion
[3] Utilized a Node server that recieves motion data from the browser via websocket emits to perform more intensive mathemticaly operations on the time series data
[4] Developed a adjustable parameters such as normilization, and frames per second that allow the frontend application to adapt to the speed, height, and size of the dancer
[6] Demoed the application at Evanston's BitCrush 2025 event, gauged user feedback and submitted plans for improvement
