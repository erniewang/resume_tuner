[0] Designed and implemented a browser application utilizing PoseNet(p5.js/m15) to caputure and analyze dance pases via a webcamera
[1] Engineered real-time tempo approximator that measures the period of movement by running a FFT over the captured velocity data over a specified time interval
[2] Established endpoints on an audio file's playbackrate, volume, and pitch that listen to tempo changes via websockets (Socket.io)
[3] Integrated with a generative music model (Vampnet) to continously generate new music based off of select characteristics and patterns in captured posenet data
[4] Architected a distributed software utilizing Node.js for reciving and inteperting data and Flask (python) to run the music generation model
[5] Developed a adjustable parameters such as normilization, and frames per second that allow users on the frontend to change the sensitivieties of input and capture rate to match the dancer
[6] Presented live demo at Evanston's BitCrush 2025 hackathon, collecting user feedback to identify key features and prioritize development roadmap
[7] Performed linear interpolation and outlier filtering on captured posedata to smooth out and standardize approximated velocity, significantly improving consistency

[0] Developed a web application enabling musicians to upload melodies in MusicXML/MXL format and download modified XML files with melodies harmonized programmatically into a musical soli
[1] Provided a heuristics modifier based off of chorst structure from Music21 (python), supporting thousands of note-chord combinations based off of known music theory principles
[2] Stored user-defined presets in browser local storage alongside providing a few well known haromization algorithms from well known music arrangers(Count Basie, Stan Kenton, Thad Jones)
[3] Implemented real-time server streaming to highlight exceptional notes and provide interactive harmonization options, allowing users to customize non-trivial chord voicings on the fly
[4] Built a customizable fallback algorithm that harmonizes on a more consistent basis on note/harmony parings that were not successfull in the intial run
[5] Improved runtime speed of music XML parsing/modifying programs 9 times by caching runtime results in a json file that is eventually stored on the users localStorage.
[6] Created a simple AWS-hosted platform where users can share and browse custom harmonization rules, fostering a small community of arrangers

[0] Developed a desktop application with Electron JS utilizes LLMS to select attributes of experiences and projects that best fit a job description
[1] Designed a layed, multipaged UI to create, modify, and save a megaresume utilizing Electron's IPC utilizing React and TailwindCSS
[2] Optimized LLM performance by implementing section-based task queuing and indexed outputs, reducing token usage by 50% and enabling granular resume optimization
[3] Developing a optional keyword extration preprocessing stage that selects keywords and verbs and `upgrades` them to match keywords of the job description
[4] Designed and implemented interactive suggestion review system in the UI with Accept/Reject/Edit options for each AI-generated resume improvement.
[5] Broaded the project to utilize plugin-based architecture supporting multiple AI providers with encrypted local storage utilizing node-keytar and model controll in the UI
[6] Established a Resume/Job dictionary on the client's localstorage that details the exact optimized resume permuation for any given job for the client to review

[0] Developed a music recommendation platform integrating OpenAI's GPT API with the Spotify's Web API, enabling dynamic playlist generation from natural language queries.
[1] Implemented relational data persistence using Amazon RDS (MySQL), storing user accounts, playlists, and historical queries to enhance personalization
[2] Deployed backend services on Amazon EC2, handling user authentication and API communication
[3] Designed and documented a RESTful API with endpoints for song discovery, listing favorites, history, catalog reset, and recommendation refinement.
